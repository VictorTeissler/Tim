# tim
They call me... tim? - A hypervisor host-based guest kernel and userland thing.


Note: This will almost 100% not work on your system.
It requires xen, vga passthrough, rekall, libvmi, and something I'm forgetting.
Code is here so I can colab on the next step - weaponizing it to hack video game(s).
